**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. For this, flexbox and grid was used. In addition, media queries were used, to make elements change size to look better on smaller devices.

**Images**

_Using a flexbox for the profile section with horizontal margins 'auto' so it is always centered to the page_
